<title>Tye's Stage 0 Project'</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Hello, my name is Tye Yamagata . I'm a 29 year-old high school dropout currently working at a<br>
grocery store, <a href="www.traderjoes.com">Trader Joe's</a>, with a dream of being a computer game developer. The prospect of being<br>
10-15 years behind other people has prevented me from pursuing this dream. This Stage 0 submission<br>
is my attempt at taking my first step in the direction of a future I can be proud of.
</p>
<p>Admittedly, I did not take any notes. : ( <br>
My current setup is for <em>gaming</em> and not for a class that I spontaneously signed up for.<br>
However, your 50% off of tuition promotion caught my eye in my e-mails, so here I am.<br>
I watched the videos and took the quizes seriously. 
</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to your feedback.
</p>
